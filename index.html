            <h1 class="me">Supp, im VitorðŸ’€</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Vitor, and I aspire to become a full-stack developer mastering Python, Java,
                PHP, and Rust. With a foundation in front-end development, I'm committed to expanding my
                skills to encompass the entire stack. My journey involves rigorous learning and hands-on
                experience, diving deep into Python for backend systems, mastering JavaScript for dynamic
                interfaces, recognizing PHP's importance in server-side scripting, and exploring Rust's
                capabilities. Through dedicated study and practical projects, I'm evolving into a proficient
                full-stack developer, one line of code at a time, to contribute meaningfully to the world
                of technology.</p>

                <strong>Task Manager</strong><br>
                This is my first complex program: a task manager with monitoring capabilities for GPU, CPU, memory, and disks, as well as the ability to terminate applications. I worked on it for a week, motivated by my dream of one day creating my own operating system.<br><br>
    
                <strong>Features:</strong><br>
                - Monitor GPU usage and temperature<br>
                - Monitor CPU usage, frequency, logical cores, and uptime<br>
                - Monitor memory usage<br>
                - Monitor disk usage for multiple disks<br>
                - Terminate running applications<br><br>
    
                <strong>About This Project:</strong><br>
                This project was a great experience but also quite stressful. I often found myself needing to finish it quickly,
                 or else I would keep wanting to perfect it even more.<br><br>
    
                <strong>Reflection:</strong><br>
                I regret using Python for this project due to its heavy performance impact.
                 If I were to redo it, I would choose Rust for better performance. Despite the challenges,
                  this experience taught me a lot and brought me a step closer to my bigger dream.
