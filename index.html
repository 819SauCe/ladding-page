            <p>
                My name is Vitor, and I aspire to become a full-stack developer mastering Python, Java,
                PHP, and Rust. With a foundation in front-end development, I'm committed to expanding my
                skills to encompass the entire stack. My journey involves rigorous learning and hands-on
                experience, diving deep into Python for backend systems, mastering JavaScript for dynamic
                interfaces, recognizing PHP's importance in server-side scripting, and exploring Rust's
                capabilities. Through dedicated study and practical projects, I'm evolving into a proficient
                full-stack developer, one line of code at a time, to contribute meaningfully to the world
                of technology.</p>

                Task Manager
                This is my first complex program:
                a task manager with monitoring capabilities for GPU, CPU,
                memory, and disks, as well as the ability to terminate
                applications. I worked on it for a week, motivated by my
                dream of one day creating my own operating system. Features
                Monitor GPU usage and temperature Monitor CPU usage,
                frequency, logical cores, and uptime Monitor memory usage
                Monitor disk usage for multiple disks Terminate running
                applications About This Project This project was a great
                experience but also quite stressful. I often found myself
                needing to finish it quickly, or else I would keep wanting
                to perfect it even more. Reflection I regret using Python
                for this project due to its heavy performance impact. If
                I were to redo it, I would choose Rust for better performance.
                Despite the challenges, this experience taught me a lot and
                brought me a step closer to my bigger dream.
